"""View-model for the live state diagram.

Nodes are positioned by a fixed cosmetic layout, but *edges, the current
state, visited states and traversed edges all come from the real
transition table and the workflow's stored history* - nothing here
simulates the engine.

Drawing rules: ordinary transitions are straight arrows; transitions that
leave and re-enter the same state (votes, reviewer reassignment) are grouped
into one loop above the state; WITHDRAW (back to IN_PROGRESS) is an arc over
the top of the diagram.
