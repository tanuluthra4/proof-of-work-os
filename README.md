# Proof of Work OS (POW-OS)

## 🚀 Overview

Proof of Work OS (POW-OS) is a productivity and execution tracking platform built for developers and students to track their real work consistency.
Instead of just claiming skills, users can show proof of execution through task completion, execution score tracking, and personal productivity management.
This project focuses on solving a real problem:
“How do you prove consistency and execution to recruiters?”

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most students say:

- I know Python
- I know DSA
- I am learning development

But recruiters cannot verify execution.

POW-OS solves this by creating a system where users can track actual work completed and generate measurable proof of consistency.

## Final Note

This project is not just a task manager.
It is a proof system for consistency.
Because skills claimed are weak.
Proof of execution is stronger.
