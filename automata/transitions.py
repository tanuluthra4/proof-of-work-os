"""The transition function (delta) of the verification automaton.

This module is *pure*: no database, no Flask. It is the single source of
truth for which moves are legal. The engine, routes, templates and the
state-diagram visualisation all read from `TRANSITIONS`.

Formally the machine is a deterministic finite automaton M = (Q, Sigma, delta, q0, F):
    Q      = the seven WorkflowState values
    Sigma  = the eleven WorkflowEvent values (two are reviewer votes)
    delta  = TRANSITIONS (a *partial* function: undefined moves are rejected)
    q0     = CREATED
    F      = {VERIFIED}   (accepting state: the proof was approved)
